# Non-NuGet Dependencies

## Emmersion.Http
Source: https://github.com/emmersion/Emmersion.Http

Justification: The package put out by Emmersion as of July 20, 2021 targets `netcoreapp3.1`. I want to consume a `netstandard2.1` version for flexibility.

# Debugging Notes

## xunit Console Logging
One of the things that makes testing difficult is that xunit does automatically write `Console.WriteLine()` statements to the test output. It also does not write to the debug console when debugging tests. I have found that when using JetBrains Rider in my setup on Windows it writes the test output to this directory `~\AppData\Local\JetBrains\Rider2021.3\log\UnitTestLogs\Sessions`. Obviously that will change based on the version of Rider.

One of my goals is to build a way for xunit to output to a `List<string>` so it can be analyzed at test assertion time. For a CLI tool this seems like an important thing to be able to test. If you know how to do this please feel free to reach out or submit a PR. 😁 Cheers!
